## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on the [DeepTactics Muzero project](https://github.com/CogitoNTNU/DeepTactics-Muzero) at Cogito NTNU.
- Proud contributor to the `pyenv` project:
    - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/releases/tag/v2.5.0
    - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/releases/tag/v2.5.3

I hate bloat.

By the way, open source is cool. The mentality which exists there should be applied elsewhere as well 😄
    - Either you follow the guidelines or GTFO.

Be real guys (and girls) 👍👍 😜
